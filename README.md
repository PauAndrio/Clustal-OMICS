# Clustal-OMICS
This repository contains a developed web-application for doing Clustal-Omega multiple sequences alignment using Python and Flask. <p>
The html page consists of a description and user-manual to work with the application, a form to introduce the input either as a pasted multi fasta sequence, using Uniprot IDs or uploading a file. <p>
When submitting the input, the user gets redirected to a results.html page that displays the result of the multiple sequence alignment and provides a link to download it as a file.

```
git clone https://github.com/dexposito98/Clustal_Omega_WebApplication

2) Install the required packages: <p>

3) Go to the app folder and start the application
